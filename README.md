Dev Notes
---------

*Following proposals are implemented in this version. Feel free to comment and not agree. Proposal: comments as lists under
each proposal; it would (hopefully) leave nice thought stack.*

**Proposal:** Where possible, use list literals (ArrayLists are the fastest non-array linear data structure). ~F

**Proposal:** Represent evaluations as double and probability as integer (attribute of value x would mean probability of x/1000) ~F
 
**Note:** Components using Evolution Context (see dictionary for all capitalized terms) are not forced to work together 
    by any type-safety techniques. You can create ContextManager that will not provide informations needed by your 
    implementation of CP, and that is your fault. The contract makes keeping it consistent your duty. ~F  

Dictionary
----------

* Specimen - object in searched space (function tree i some form, in case of our problem)
* Population - list of _Specimen_ s
* Evaluation - function fromsearched space to real numbers (represented as double), which should be minimalised (minimised? linguistic help, pleas)
* Generation - number of processed population; number of genetic algorithms iteration
* CP - crossover probability; may change with each generation
* MP - mutation probability; may change with each generation
* (Evolution) Context - namespace to keep all statistics on past and current populations, for parameter adaptation sake
* Context handler - piece of logic that takes care of filling context with statistics at the beginning of each GA iteration.
